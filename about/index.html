    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I have an undergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Geography with minors in Design and Architecture. I also have a Master of Library & Information Science (MLIS) from St. Catherine University (as of May 2019).
    </p>
    <p>
      During my MLIS coursework I focused on the interactions between information, technology, people, and society. I took several database courses, where I learned about using SQL and PHP to design, build, and interact with relational databases. I also took an Internet Fundamentals & Design course, where I fell in love with web development. We learned how to design and create a website from scratch using HTML and CSS. Since then, I have worked to learn and practice more skills and technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning and found that the ever-changing web development is perfect for keeping my mind active...there are always new technologies and techniques to tackle.
    </p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy photography, editing my photos (see some of my work on <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/plethora4834">Flickr</a>), hiking, jigsaw puzzles, crossword puzzles, reading, and hanging out with friends & family.</p>

    <h2>Why I Love Web Development</h2>
    <p>Web development combines many of my favorite things:</p>
    <ul class="love-webdev">
      <li>Solving puzzles <span>(How can I do this?)</span></li>
      <li>Creative thinking <span>(Is there a another way?)</span></li>
      <li>Research <span>(Let me Google it.)</span></li>
      <li>Visual design <span>(How can I make this pretty?)</span></li>
      <li>Organizing and sharing information <span>(How do I ensure this makes sense to users?)</span></li>
      <li>Building stuff <span>(Look, I made a thing!)</span></li>
      <li>Technology <span>(Computers can do awesome stuff!)</span></li>
    </ul>
